    "# Introduction: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a fictional medical institute looking to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts, and I have been tasked to devise some of the logic and calculations that will underpin the app. The lottery in this case is a 6/49 model (match 6 out of 49 to win the big prize).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many gamblers develop a habit which in turn escalates into an addiction, causing severe issues within their personal lives. They may not know they have an issue until it is too late, and so this app is designed to better educate lottery addicts on their chances of winning in order to deter them.\n",
    "\n",
    "More gambling information can be found here: https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/addiction-support/gambling-addiction/\n",

    "Putting into practice theoretical and empirical probability concepts such as combinations and permutations to understand the probability of different lottery scenarios, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Probability of winning with a single ticket\n",
    " - Probability of winning if we play 40 different tickets\n",
    " - Probability of having at least five (or four, three, two) winning numbers on a single ticket\n",
    " \n",
    "### Dataset\n",

    "As part of the analysis stage, I'll use historical (Canadian) lottery data, located here: https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset"
