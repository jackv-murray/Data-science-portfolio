# Data science portfolio - Jack Murray

My collection of personal data science projects.

All the notebooks that are labelled 'beginner', 'intermediate', etc. are practice projects that i've done since learning python, and so (particularly some of the earlier ones) might be a 'little rough around the edges' or basic. I tried to do as many as I could when I picked up a new technique or library.
